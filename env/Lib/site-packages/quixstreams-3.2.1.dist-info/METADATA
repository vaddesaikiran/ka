           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Open source Python framework for reliable data engineering

Quix Streams is an end-to-end framework for real-time Python data engineering, operational analytics and machine learning on Apache Kafka data streams. Extract, transform and load data reliably in fewer lines of code using your favourite Python libraries.

Build data pipelines and event-driven microservice architectures leveraging Kafka's low-level scalability, resiliency and durability features in a lightweight library without server-side clusters to manage.

Quix Streams provides the following features to make your life easier:
- Pure Python, meaning no wrappers around Java and no cross-language debugging.
- Sources & Sinks API for building custom connectors that integrate data with Kafka.
- Streaming DataFrame API for building tabular data processing pipelines.
- Serializers API supporting JSON, Avro, Protobuf & Schema Registry.
- State API with built-in RocksDB state object for stateful processing.
- Application API for managing the Kafka-related setup, teardown and message lifecycle.
- Operators for common processing tasks like Windowing, Branching, Group By and Reduce.
- Exactly-once processing guarantees via Kafka transactions.

Use Quix Streams to build simple Kafka producer/consumer applications or leverage stream processing to build complex event-driven systems, real-time data pipelines and AI/ML products.

## Getting Started 🏄

### Install Quix Streams

```shell
# PyPI
python -m pip install quixstreams

# or conda
conda install -c conda-forge quixio::quixstreams
```

#### Requirements
Python 3.9+, Apache Kafka 0.10+

See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams/blob/main/requirements.txt) for the full list of requirements

### Documentation
[Quix Streams Docs](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/introduction.html)

### Example

Here's an example of how to <b>process</b> data from a Kafka Topic with Quix Streams:

```python
from quixstreams import Application

# A minimal application reading temperature data in Celsius from the Kafka topic,
# converting it to Fahrenheit and producing alerts to another topic.

# Define an application that will connect to Kafka
app = Application(
    broker_address="localhost:9092",  # Kafka broker address
)

# Define the Kafka topics
temperature_topic = app.topic("temperature-celsius", value_deserializer="json")
alerts_topic = app.topic("temperature-alerts", value_serializer="json")

# Create a Streaming DataFrame connected to the input Kafka topic
sdf = app.dataframe(topic=temperature_topic)

# Convert temperature to Fahrenheit by transforming the input message (with an anonymous or user-defined function)
sdf = sdf.apply(lambda value: {"temperature_F": (value["temperature"] * 9/5) + 32})

# Filter values above the threshold
sdf = sdf[sdf["temperature_F"] > 150]

# Produce alerts to the output topic
sdf = sdf.to_topic(alerts_topic)

# Run the streaming application (app automatically tracks the sdf!)
app.run()
```

### Tutorials

To see Quix Streams in action, check out the Quickstart and Tutorials in the docs: 

- [**Quickstart**](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/quickstart.html)
- [**Tutorial - Word Count**](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/tutorials/word-count/tutorial.html)
- [**Tutorial - Anomaly Detection**](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/tutorials/anomaly-detection/tutorial.html)
- [**Tutorial - Purchase Filtering**](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/tutorials/purchase-filtering/tutorial.html)


### Key Concepts
There are two primary objects:
- `StreamingDataFrame` - a predefined declarative pipeline to process and transform incoming messages.
- `Application` - to manage the Kafka-related setup, teardown and message lifecycle (consuming, committing). It processes each message with the dataframe you provide for it to run.

Under the hood, the `Application` will:
- Consume and deserialize messages.
- Process them with your `StreamingDataFrame`.
- Produce it to the output topic.
- Automatically checkpoint processed messages and state for resiliency.
- Scale using Kafka's built-in consumer groups mechanism.


### Deployment
You can run Quix Streams pipelines anywhere Python is installed.

Deploy to your own infrastructure or to [Quix Cloud](https://quix.io/product) on AWS, Azure, GCP or on-premise for a fully managed platform.  
You'll get self-service DevOps, CI/CD and monitoring, all built with best in class engineering practices learned from Formula 1 Racing.

Please see the [**Connecting to Quix Cloud**](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/quix-platform.html) page 
to learn how to use Quix Streams and Quix Cloud together.
